# âœ¨ Data Sorting Visualizer

ðŸ“¶ This is a cool data visualizer I built! Check it out: [Data Sorting Visualizer](https://shadielfares.github.io/DataSortingVisualizer/).

### Overview
This project visualizes various data sorting algorithms. It was initially built as a functionality tool and a learning tool for myself, so its UI could benefit from enhancements.

### Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms are implemented in this visualizer:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Next Steps
1. **Improve UI Design**: The current UI was designed when I was less experienced with design. Future improvements should focus on:
   - Enhancing visual aesthetics.
   - Improving user experience.
   - Adding interactive elements.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improving the UI or implementing additional algorithms, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.
